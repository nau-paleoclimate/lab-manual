[["index.html", "NAU Paleoclimate Lab Manual Chapter 1 Welcome!", " NAU Paleoclimate Lab Manual Nick McKay Last updated: 2022-01-28 Chapter 1 Welcome! test This is the lab manual for the for the paleoclimate Group at Northern Arizona University. Altogether, we do a lot of work across the field of paleoclimatology, but have particular expertise in the late Quaternary (especially Holocene), and have emphases in high-latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) paleoclimate, paleolimnology, paleoclimate informatics, multiproxy data synthesis and data-model intercomparison. This lab manual resource is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Nick (nick@nau.edu) or make a pull request. This book was inspired by The Fay Lab’s manual, and we drew heavily on their manual as we developed ours.   This lab manual is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 How we meet 2.2 How we give feedback 2.3 How we share things, internally and with the rest of the world", " Chapter 2 Introduction [More information about our research] [To come: recommended reading list] We should do this! 2.1 How we meet Currently, we meet as a group in-person and on zoom on Thursday mornings, from 9-10:30. Students and postdocs also meet 1:1 in person or on Zoom with their advisor, typically on a weekly basis. We use Googledocs to set agendas, record decisions made, and outline action items during meetings. Each lab member has their own google doc for their 1:1 meetings. Prior to each meeting, create your agenda for that meeting there. 2.2 How we give feedback Feedback, both giving and receiving it, is an important aspect of our lab. We expect feedback to be supportive but constructive. This resource from UBC does a really great job of outlining the main points of how to give and receive feedback. 2.3 How we share things, internally and with the rest of the world It is useful to have standard ways of sharing things. These don’t always have to be followed but are a useful guide and will make things easier. When sending material to someone, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for them to help you. Taking a project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others, as things tend to be self-contained. Try to keep only 1 working instance of material, and use some form of version control to facilitate this (see recommendations in Good enough practices in scientific computing , by Wilson et al.). Project management tools in Github are a good way to record and document questions on analyses. Use ‘Issues’ on github repositories for project-related tasks and problems. Alternatively, make use of a GoogleDoc for each project to record this history, much like you would a lab notebook. Code: can be shared via Github repositories, or via a dedicated Google Drive folder. For specific questions on problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared. Writing: Preferably via GoogleDoc, R Markdown, or Overleaf, but MS Word documents can also be shared. Google docs are particularly useful for collaborative writing, and have the advantage of there only ever being one version (as opposed to files that are sent around via email). Word documents should always have your last name as the first part of the file name (e.g. please no “mythesis.doc”). Ideas: We have an NAU-Paleoclimate Slack that we use extensively, for group, small group, and 1:1 communication. It’s a community-driven resource, however, the messages and files shared that way are not permanent, so keep copies. NPM: I like this idea, should adopt? We maintain a lab Google Drive folder for lab publications, presentations, photos, CVs, etc. Please make use of these so that others in the lab can make fair use of our work. NPM: Some more ideas here: ## Shared lab resources Where to find shared resources: - Google Drive - You will be given access to the shared drive during onboarding, take a look at the Lab Meetings folder to find Lab Meeting Notes for each semester - GitHub - nau-paleoclimate is the shared GitHub account for the lab - lab-manual - This repository contains the lab manual, see section for other useful resources - Lab meeting schedule - Website - Should we make a lab website? "],["culture.html", "Chapter 3 Lab culture and philosophy", " Chapter 3 Lab culture and philosophy We approach our science with a common denominator of kindness. As part of our core lab culture, we: Ask for help, and share our learning Make ourselves available Come prepared and engage Celebrate accomplishments (ours &amp; those of others) Sustain a positive, safe learning environment Have an interdisciplinary (open) mindset Are mindful of our own biases Plan with intention, and follow through Foster inclusivity within our group and greater community Promote and sustain healthy work-life integration Practice radical candor Acknowledge and give credit to other lab member’s work Though we do not expect incoming members to memorize everything, we do expect members to be aware of the group’s values. Ask for help, and share your learning: We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognizance of the value of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the lab issues repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. NPM: Should we create a repository for lab issues/discusion? Make yourself available: Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming (see note below on planning and organization). Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is expected that you be available in the lab/office during normal business hours for some time during the week (see section on attendance expectations). Come prepared and be engaged: Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as events that contribute to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them. Celebrate accomplishments (yours &amp; others): You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others! Sustain a positive, safe learning environment: Everyone learns something for the first time at some time, and people learn in different ways. Expressing that you don’t know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn. Have an interdisciplinary (open) mindset: Our research is interdisciplinary. This means we work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization, but also speak up when you have ideas that challenge the status quo of a different discipline. Great discoveries often happen when something that is common knowledge in one arena is applied to a problem in a different area! Be mindful and aware of your own biases: We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases. Plan with intention, and follow through: Be organized and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you (see “How we work”); being organized can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals. Foster inclusivity within our group and greater community: Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within the School of Earth ans Sustainability and the University, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones. Work with your advisor when crafting your [NPM: is this something we should do? individual mentoring/development plans (see Chapter on Onboarding)] to identify what you want to aim your efforts at. Promote and sustain healthy work-life integration: Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Make sure you do not normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status. Practice radical candor: We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative. Don’t take constructive criticism personally. Acknowledge and give credit: Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work (see “Ask for help”), and using others’ words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours. "],["code.html", "Chapter 4 Code of Conduct 4.1 Short version 4.2 Longer version 4.3 License and attribution", " Chapter 4 Code of Conduct A Code of Conduct is a set of basic ground rules that we ask participants in lab spaces to follow. The goal is to create an open and inclusive space for our work that helps us achieve our collective goals. Along with our lab culture/philosophy, it also provides a benchmark for self-evaluation and helps better define our identity as a community. Our code of conduct has been reviewed by the SMAST Dean’s Office and by UMassD Human Resources and office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We expect all lab members to adhere to the policies and guidelines outlined here. Additional information and resources can be found in the SMAST Code of Conduct and Diversity Statement. 4.1 Short version The Fay lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form and prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. This code of conduct applies to all Fay lab spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, social events, email correspondence, and web channels and code repositories, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the university’s academic policies. Some Fay lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. 4.2 Longer version The Fay lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of group members or others in our larger communities in any form. Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form provides definitions and examples of harassment and sexual harassment. This code of conduct applies to all Fay lab spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, social get togethers, email correspondence, and web channels and code repositories, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the School’s and university’s academic policies. Some Fay lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. Harassment includes: Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment. Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names. Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate. Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop. Threats of violence. Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm. Deliberate intimidation. Stalking or following. Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes. Sustained disruption of discussion. Unwelcome sexual attention. Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease. Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse. Publication of non-harassing private communication. The Fay lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The PI (Gavin Fay) reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding: ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.” Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions 4.2.1 Reporting If you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the PI, Dr. Gavin Fay, at gfay@umassd.edu. If you do not wish to contact Dr. Fay, please contact Department Chair Dr. Steve Cadrin scadrin@umassd.edu and/or SMAST Assistant Dean Mike Marino mmarino@umassd.edu. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can. Lab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of Massachusetts’ policies and/or the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. Information about the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form. Confidentiality: Please remember that by way of his position at the university, Dr. Fay is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that he is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Dr. Fay, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Gavin will do his best to remind you of his responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. If you would prefer to discuss incidents of harassment that fall under Title IX with a confidential source, you can contact David Gomes, UMass Dartmouth Director of Diversity and Inclusion. This code of conduct applies to Fay lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab or another member of the SMAST community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Fay lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Fay lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Fay lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Fay lab. The University Counseling Center provides a range of services to help students develop improved coping skills to address emotional, interpersonal and academic concerns. To protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. The above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Fay lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. 4.2.2 Consequences Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dr. Fay may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair and Dean’s Office under the SMAST policy, and also including expulsion from all Fay lab spaces. 4.2.3 Additional resources Other University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees and University documents: Policy Against Intolerance Principles of Employee Conduct Resolution in Support of Pluralism Non-Discrimination and Harassment Policy Statement of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Statement on Cultural Diversity and Inclusion Statement on Gender Discrimination Bully, Harassment and Violence Student Conduct Policies and Procedures Sexual Harassment Policy Title IX and Sexual Assault/Harassment 4.3 License and attribution This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy created by the Geek Feminism community.

IT Help for new students and staff/faculty Here, you can navigate to the “Are you new?” section and select either student or staff. 6.3 Individual Development/Mentoring plans Within the first few weeks of joining the Fay Lab, you should work with Gavin to develop a plan outlining your short, medium, and long term goals. More on individual developing plans can be found in Chapter 7. 6.4 Timesheets (graduate students do not need to complete timesheets) You can access you timesheets through the HR portal in. Navigate to Quicklaunch and click on HRDirect. You need to enter your UMassD user ID, password, and select the Dartmouth campus. If this is the first time you do this, you will also need to verify your account through DUO authorization. We recommend using the DUO app on your phone. You can choose to have push access, or send codes. After your initial setup, you can also opt to go through DUO 1/month (instead of every time you login to HRDirect). Even if you are salaried, it’s still important to keep track of and submit your vacation and sick time! 6.5 Facilities Currently all work in the lab is being performed remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All access to SMAST facilities requires prior approval from Gavin, Mike Marino, and Eric Lyonnais. No work is to be performed on site until further notice. 6.5.1 Office space Our physical lab space is in the SMAST-East (new) building. The lab is room 245. Ashleigh’s desk is in the lab. Gavin’s office is room 228. Everyone in the lab is provided with desk space. Lab members sit either in the lab itself, or in the shared graduate student cubicle space and shared postdoc offices. Gavin encourages people to set up and work where is most comfortable. Graduate students should make use of their allocated space in the shared area but can do computational work in the lab area. Lab meetings are held either in the lab, or in one of the SMAST-E conference rooms. 6.5.2 Key card building &amp; room access Access to the SMAST building, and to individual lab spaces within the building is through your UMass Pass keycard. Typically, you will have access to the SMAST gate, SMAST East building, the lab space (room #245), classrooms, and if you are a grad student/postdoc you will have access to the relevant shared office space. The necessary building access forms can be found on the SMAST Occupants page which need to be filled out and approved and signed by Gavin before submitting to Mike Marino and Eric Lyonnais. 6.5.3 Parking and transportation: Parking at either of the SMAST buildings is free and no parking pass is required. Parking on the main UMassD campus requires a digital parking pass. If you are staff this pass is free, there is a fee for students. Full details for campus parking policies and procedures are on the UMassD parking webpage. Note that there is limited short-term/temporary parking available on campus so you may feel it’s not necessary to obtain a campus parking pass. "],["expectations.html", "Chapter 7 Expectations 7.1 Working hours 7.2 Email 7.3 Attendance at regularly scheduled events 7.4 Outreach 7.5 Expectations for the PI 7.6 Graduate students 7.7 Undergraduate students 7.8 Postdoctoral researchers 7.9 Research staff", " Chapter 7 Expectations In addition to agreeing to follow our communities codes of conduct and the university academic integrity policy, we expect everyone in the group to echo our lab culture (Chapter 3). [NPM: is this something we should do?] Individual mentoring plans: We will work with each of you to develop your individual mentoring plan that serves to ensure your time in the group progresses your short, medium, and long-term goals. This is a useful planning document that assists in aligning expectations. Graduate students will revisit the mentoring plan during an individual meeting with Gavin at the beginning of each semester &amp; the start of summer. Other lab members will revisit these at appropriate time scales (e.g. every 6 months). A template for these, with thanks to @duffy_ma can be found here. In addition, it is useful to have broad (for all lab members) and specific (i.e., grad students, research staff, etc.) expectations of our roles clarified. These are outlined below. 7.1 Working hours We generally do not hold people to working a fixed schedule, or to be in the office for a certain schedule. As adults, we should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these. Nick generally does not work evenings or on weekends, and does not expect that people in the lab are available at these times. Lab members should also not expect others to be available during these times. Graduate students are generally funded on graduate assistantships, either teaching (TA) or research (RA) assistantships. Most (but not all) students have a mix of RA and TAships over the course of their degrees. TAships are intended to average 20 hrs per week (for all activities) during the semester. It’s not uncommon for the actual commitment to be less than this, but if your TA duties are consistently occupying you for more than 20 hours a week, you should discuss this with your advisor. The RA contracts state that this stipend is for 20 hrs of work per week during the semester. Most usually, students on RAships are being paid from a research grant where the focus of the grant is the topic the student is working on for their thesis research, so there is overlap here. Some people find that counting ‘billable hours’ is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves. Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you. Full time is enough, and we do not expect team members to work nights and weekends, though do not enforce a particular working hours schedule because students should feel flexible enough to create a work schedule that works for them. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized. 7.2 Email In the group, we communicate via email and slack. You should therefore check and respond to important emails, and check in on slack at least once a day during the normal work week. We also make use of Google Docs to hold conversations regarding research tasks. Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Do not expect responses to emails after regular business hours on weekdays, or on weekends. However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members should not be penalized for sending communication during these times. 7.3 Attendance at regularly scheduled events Attendance is expected at: * Departmental seminars * Weekly lab meetings * Individual meetings with your advisor(s) to discuss and work on your research * Relevant thesis and dissertation defenses 7.4 Outreach We share our learning and time with others beyond our group, knowing that this builds community and ultimately improves both the quality and impact of our science. This doesn’t mean individuals do everything, however. Group members often take on leadership roles within the university, are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, actively participate in community and university events, and perform outreach. Ask others in the group about activities they are part of, and work with Gavin when crafting your mentoring plan to identify outreach strategy that meshes well with your goals. 7.5 Expectations for the PI Your advisor (as PI) will (at a minimum) provide: * Technical support for analysis (e.g., access to computing, training on techniques) * Positive feedback &amp; constructive criticism on work * Professional career support * Support for non-technical aspects of making career progress * Regular meetings (at least every two weeks) to discuss work &amp; maintain progress on goals * Provide clear and honest appraisal of your funding situation 7.6 Graduate students You are responsible for your degree. This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc. [npm: this needs to be connected to NAU stuff]. See Chapter ?? &amp; Chapter ?? for links to resources. Before registering for each semester, you are required to meet with your advisor to review your course progression and discuss plans for the forthcoming semester (classes, activities, etc.). Course of study: Work with your advisor when crafting and revisiting your individual mentoring plans to identify classes that you will take during your academic program. We schedule regular individual meetings with Gavin throughout the year. At a minimum during the semester these will take place every two weeks, although weekly is more common. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with your advisor(s) to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, so come with an agenda with a list of things that you want to accomplish and work on during that time. We share our research at local, national, and international meetings, and publish our findings in the scientific literature. Your advisor(s) strives to provide financial support for grad students to attend at least one major conference during their program (for MS students), or once per year for PhD students. You should expect to give a presentation (a poster or a talk) on your work at these. 7.6.1 Funding Almost always, we only accept students if we’re able to guarantee at least 4 semesters of funding for MS students, and 8 semesters of funding for PhD students. This is typically a combination of grant (RA) and teaching (TA) assistantships Students are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. There are many opportunities out there, particularly for students. Some resources are outlined in Chapter 9. 7.7 Undergraduate students You will most likely be working with one of the lab’s research team as your primary research supervisor. The grad student or postdoc you are working with on your project will be your primary source of contact and you should work with them to establish and define your work schedule, protocols for your work, and to ensure you have the necessary equipment to perform your work tasks. Although the grad student / postdoc is your primary contact, always feel like you can reach out to both Nick and Darrell as the senior group leaders. We are excited to help you use your position in the lab to further your career goals and want to work with you to help you achieve them. If you are an hourly worker (either federal work study or grant supported) then it is critical that you complete your timesheets through Louie with your hours worked, so that you can get paid. Please submit your electronic timesheet each week by noon on Friday, to allow time for your supervisor to approve. Alert your research supervisor AND Nick or Darrell as soon as possible if there are any complications with regard to pay. We want you to be compensated for your work in a timely fashion. 7.8 Postdoctoral researchers Postdocs are independent researchers and likely will likely have significant collaboration with researchers at other institutions as part of their research and position. In general, postdocs are expected to: * Be present and involved in lab meetings, workshops, campus seminars, and conferences. * Provide mentorship, technical support, and assistance to other lab members * Communicate both successes and sticking points on a regular basis with the PI * Work independently and collaboratively * Participate in professional development opportunities * Lead and assist in designated research projects * Develop and submit proposals to fund future research As a postdoc, a major part of your job is to look for your next job. While a postdoctoral position is a scientific research position, it is also a training opportunity and a step to something else, and a full-time permanent position beats a postdoc. Do not feel bad or awkward about pursuing (and taking) employment opportunities, and also training opportunities that help you move toward that next step. We want you to succeed! Postdocs will likely have active roles on advisory working groups or other professional service roles. If opportunities are not immediately apparent through your funded research, then your advisor can help strategize about where is a useful space to target your involvement. 7.9 Research staff Much like post-docs, research staff operate as independent and collaborative researchers on assigned projects. As these positions are often working directly alongside your mentor/direct collaborator on particular lab projects, meetings may be more frequent than those with others in the lab. Weekly meetings should have clear agendas, and can often be used as collaborative working time to make progress on specific tasks. In general, staff are expected to: Be present and involved in lab meetings, workshops, campus seminars, and conferences Provide technical support and assistance to other lab members Communicate both successes and sticking points on a regular basis with PI Work independently and collaboratively Lead and assist in designated research projects Participate in professional development opportunities (i.e., workshops, conferences, submitting previous position manuscripts [without detracting from new position]) Seek and pursue new funding opportunities when appropriate (this will likely be dependent on your timeline) Produce expected output from assigned grants Be flexible! Additional projects may be assigned to give additional funding for your position Serve as a role model and go-to resource for other members of the lab Research staff positions may be somewhat flexible in scope. For example, the position may include some lab management, leadership, and communication responsibilities. Exact set of responsibilities and duties will be clearly defined in your position description and expectations agreed on in your work plan.

[to do: check and adapt this for us] Checklist for students, staff, and post docs 8.2 Project Documentation Project work should be hosted either in a github repository linked to from the nau-paleoclimate account, or saved on the NAU paleoclimate google drive. Each project should have an easily found README text file that provides information for others so they can navigate and use your work, and give contact information for authors (and any data creators/use restrictions if proprietary data). Ideally, the README should also include links to publications and presentations from the work. 8.3 Publications and Presentations Ensure that publications and presentations from your projects are archived in the appropriate folder on the lab Google Drive. 8.4 Data Data used in support of your projects should be: Saved in appropriate, non-proprietary format with accompanying metadata Either in a public archive (e.g., the github repo or another public archive), or if data is proprietary, a ‘snapshot’ version of the data used in the project should be saved in a private repository accessible to lab members. Alternatively, data could be saved on the lab_fay server drive with appropriate documentation. Linked and briefly described in the project README. 8.5 Code Code used or developed for the project should be: complete and well-documented, including information in a README about what each file does and workflow to run the code Saved on the lab_fay section of the storage server, and also preferably available on github in a public repository. 8.6 Timelines for publications Science is not finished until it has been communicated. Hopefully, you will publish your results in the peer-reviewed literature so that others can learn and build from your work. During your exit interview, make a plan with your advisor for remaining publications, including a timeline for submission. 8.7 Turning in equipment Ensure any lab equipment you have been using has been returned to the lab, office furniture is present and accounted for. 8.8 Lab library Return all books checked out from the lab library. 8.9 Keys Return your keys to E&amp;S staff in the main office. 8.10 Affiliate status Depending on your plans and the status of on going work, it may be appropriate to become an affiliate with NAU after you leave. Please discuss this with your advisor at your exit interview. "],["funding.html", "Chapter 9 Funding", " Chapter 9 Funding We typically do no accept students into the lab without being able to guarantee full funding (2 years for MS students, 4 years for PhD). Position openings in the lab will be posted through the lab website, twitter account, and via other distribution feeds (e.g. listsrvs). We encourage all students to apply for external funding through graduate scholarships. Some relevant ones include … Here is a living document of recurring funding opporunities [NPM: we need one of these] Google Doc. We not only encourage students to obtain additional funding, but also staff and post-docs. And for all to apply for travel grants when attending conferences, where applicable. This resource is updated fairly regularly, and largely contains resources to fund yourself/research. It includes the opportunity name, institution, link, grad/undergrad/postdoc/all/early career/etc designation, the deadline, and important notes. We will also share funding opportunities as they come up, either to the group or in individual meetings. "],["communication.html", "Chapter 10 Communication 10.1 Inclusive science communication 10.2 Curriculum Vitae 10.3 Personal Websites 10.4 Twitter 10.5 Social Media 10.6 Contributing to regional publications and media", " Chapter 10 Communication Acknowledge communication and engage with others about your work. This includes communication with the lab team, your peers, collaborators, and also communicating your work to others. If someone works on something for you or provides you with feedback on your work, thank them and engage with them on their feedback. Our science improves by engaging with conversations about your work. View such interactions as opportunities to be collaborative rather than evaluative. Chances are if someone asks you questions about your work it is because they are interested in your science. Acknowledging communication and thanking others for their work is part of the profession, and it also helps collaboration by continuing conversation. While our philosophy applies, in that you shouldn’t feel like you have to be on email all the time, don’t let you email inbox become a black hole where questions / thoughts get sucked into and no response emerges. We also believe in being intentional in communicating our work. While publishing and conference presentations are thought of as the standard forms in which science is disseminated, there are a number of ways in which you can communicate your work with others, depending on your audiences and chosen levels of engagement. You should always invest in these at the level that is of interest to you. Here are some things we recommend as members of our team. 10.1 Inclusive science communication This Google Doc resource created and curated by Dr. Sunshine Menezes, the ED of the Metcalf Institute at URI, covers a wide range of topics related to inclusive science communication, education, and public engagement with STEM topics. We suggest you take a look! 10.2 Curriculum Vitae Keep your CV up to date. We share our CVs within the group in [NPM: we need this] this Google Drive folder, both to give each other ideas about what to include, but also having these in one place makes it easier for Gavin and others to reference information from them when needed. Here is a link to a lab-chat issue on CV building based on a 05/05/2020 lab meeting. 10.2.1 Google Scholar profiles Having a Google Scholar profile is a very easy way to curate your web presence and have a place where people can find you and your published papers and reports. We recommend everyone sets up a Google Scholar profile as soon as they have a paper or technical report. It takes about 5-10 minutes to set up, and one advantage is that Google Scholar self-updates and will add your papers and citations as you publish and people use your work. This is a really easy step to creating a web presence without having to set up a website. 10.3 Personal Websites Why have your own website? People will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to. Give people an easy way to find you and your work. One way to do this is a personal website. This doesn’t have to be extensive, but can be a good way to curate your web presence. There are heaps of tools out there to create and publish websites. Our recommendation is to choose something that it is easy to update, and fun / interesting for you to use. Many options are free. Some options for creating sites include: GoogleSites, Weebly, Squarespace, WordPress, R Markdown, GitHub. What should you include? Ultimately this is up to you and how you would like to present yourself and your work. But some common things you could include are: not an exhaustive list BioSketch Research interests/overview Projects Publications CV Blog posts Contact info An example website (though many amazing others exist and you should check those out): Ashleigh’s webpage using the free version of Weebly 10.4 Twitter Twitter is a great tool for interacting with others about your science. It is also a great platform for learning about new research and papers, finding out about jobs and fellowships, learning and discussing methods, discussing topics about how we do science, professional development, mental health and expectations around science and graduate school, and is a great venue for bringing ones whole self to the science. etc. Most of us have our own personal Twitter accounts and use them to varying degress. 10.5 Social Media As you know, there are many social media platforms, and many (all?) of these are being used in some way for science communication. This includes but not limited to: Twitter Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok Youtube Researchgate All have a different purpose and type of engagement. Think deliberately about how (and if) you want to use these tools. Using social media as part of your science communication portfolio can be useful and is popular, but it is not a requirement to be a successful scientist. 10.6 Contributing to regional publications and media We often get the opportunity to share our science with local media, or give our take on the climate science topic du jour. Nick and Darrell often get more requests than others, but we also both prefer for more junior members of the group, including students, to get the opportunity to work with the media. If this is something you’re really excited about, let us know! If this is something you don’t want to do, that’s also ok, let us know and we won’t pass anything your way. If you do get the opportunity to work with a reporter, either directly or via your advisor, you are never obligated to do so.

Our team uses the open source software R and python for a lot of their workflow, and some of us still use Matlab when we have to. If you’re not comfortable with scientific programming yet, that’s ok, don’t let it intimidate you! You can do a great thesis without being a computing wizard. However, gaining at least familiarity with the tools is worth the time investment. Fortunuately, there are heaps of resources (including your labmates!) to help you with your learning. 13.1 Overview of Computing at NAU As a student of NAU, Information Technology Services (CITS) provides access to essential resources and help when you need it. Information on how to set up your NAU login can be found on the Somewhere, TBD. A list of available programs and licensed software can be found on the Software Licensing page. 13.2 Hig performance computing facilities at NAU Once you are set up with your NAU login, you will need to submit an Access Request Form to gain access to Monsoon our HPC cluster. This form can be found here. 13.3 Administrator Privileges Your computer is often your main piece of lab research equipment, it is important to be able to use it effectively. Please ensure you are familiar with procedures for and have the ability to make changes on your computer as an administrator. 13.4 Remote meetings via Zoom NAU uses Zoom as its conference call software solution. Everyone should activate their Zoom Pro account which is part of the university license 13.5 Collaborative software Review For writing, we collaborate using GoogleDocs. For code and analyses we encourage the use of version control (see Wilson et al. paper for what this could look like), stepping toward the use of git and github for sharing code and analyses. We believe there are many advantages of using these tools to help simplify workflows and shift cognitive load to the science being done rather than on organization and bookkeeping (which computers are good at). Recognizing that these tools represent a learning curve, we provide training in their use, and also encourage alternatives for sharing and documenting work. For example, code and analyses may also be shared among collaborators using a Google Drive folder. 13.6 Backups and set up to Lab storage server The average life expectancy of a hard drive is less than the duration of most graduate programs. Thus it is critical to ensure your data and work are backed up regularly. You may have personal backup solutions (e.g. through Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.), and something that works automatically is typically ideal. 13.7 Introductory R learning resources Welcome to R! There are so many learning resources out there it can feel a little overwhelming in terms of what to choose! To get you set up and started, Happy Git and Github for the useR is a great resource, and is created by the same authors as the now-legendary stat545.com course. Their resources are extremely comprehensive and they have a fantastic Intro R course, especially for those who will be using R for doing statistics. Right now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid &amp; @allisonhorst. They teach a lot of the workflow and tools around using R right from the get go, which we think is more helpful than knowing how to do all the things. The (excellent) materials are thoughtfully put together, link to a ton of other great resources, and just like the online #rstats community in general, are super supportive of new learners. We also really like the Teacup Giraffes R and statistics materials from Desirée De Leon and Hasse Walum. If you want a book to work from/through, R for Data Science is highly recommended. (book is free online) The R Studio Education team have assembled a phenomenal array of courses, tutorials, and other materials for learning R, and for many types of data analyses and modeling using R. These are top notch and so thoughtfully put together. There is something for learners at all levels. A plug for the online R community. Follow the hashtag #rstats, &amp; also check out accounts @RLadiesGlobal &amp; @R4dsCommunity. The weekly #TidyTuesday social coding project is also a great way to practice your growing R skills. Have fun! The R4dsCommunity Slack is a briliant resource for getting help to your R questions and finding tutorials. They also hold online Office Hours where you can get help with R from a real human. The RStudio Community is a great go-to. Learn R from within R with interactive sessions using swirlstats.com. The carpentries R lessons are also a fab resource.
